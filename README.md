# Cheer Clock v1 November, 2022

The [Pimoroni Galactic Unicorn](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/galactic-unicorn?variant=40057440960595) is a
fantastic LED reader board! It covers much of your tinkering needs. This code sample allows you to program the
included 
[Raspberry Pi PICO W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) to do a couple of
really cool IoT things:
* Create a bright, easy to read, Internet synchronized clock, for your desk or workbench
* Tune into the global "mood ring" that is the [Cheerlights Community](https://cheerlights.com/). Set your clock's
  background color to the same color as thousands of other devices around the world.

## What's in this GitHub repository:
* [MicroPython Code](./MicroPython/) - The source code for the clock shown above.
* [Laser-cut templates](./Case_Template/) - The SVG files for the box-joint case and the acrylic diffuser grill.
